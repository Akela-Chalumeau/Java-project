# Java-project

We wanted that the player could have the "naughty" role, and let the "good" role the the adverse/IA. 
We choose our images along this decision.

We used different images for this projet :
1 for the space :
Given by the teachers

2 for the "neutral" side :
- the planet
- an asteroid as "spaceship"

2 for the "player" side :
- the plantet
- the spaceship, from the Star Wars saga

2 for the "adverse" side :
- the planet, a jigglypuf
- the unicorn spaceship http://www.qygjxz.com/unicorn-images/4665859.html
